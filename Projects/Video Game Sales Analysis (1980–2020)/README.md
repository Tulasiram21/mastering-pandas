# 📊 Global Video Game Sales Analysis (1980–2020)

### 📌 Project Description

This project uses **Pandas** to perform an end-to-end analysis of video game sales data. It demonstrates key skills in **data cleaning**, **feature engineering** (such as creating `Decade` and `Total_Regional_Sales` columns), and **exploratory analysis** with pivot tables. The analysis highlights sales trends across different decades, identifies the most successful genres and platforms in various regions, and uncovers insights into the evolution of the gaming industry over time.
