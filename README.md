## My Pandas Learning Journey
This repository documents my progress in learning the pandas library for data analysis in Python. It includes code and projects ranging from basic Series and DataFrame creation to more advanced data manipulation techniques.

# Pandas Series Introduction

This project demonstrates the basics of creating a Pandas Series. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold various data types.

The first task shows how to create a basic Series with a default numeric index. The second task highlights the importance of using a **custom index**, which makes the data more readable and meaningful by providing descriptive labels instead of generic numbers.

# Pandas DataFrames: Creation and Selection

This project focuses on the core concepts of the Pandas DataFrame, a two-dimensional data structure that's essential for data analysis in Python.

It demonstrates how to:
- Create a DataFrame from a Python dictionary.
- Select a single column, which returns a Pandas Series.
- Select a specific row by its index using the `.loc` accessor.
- Select multiple columns at once, which returns a new DataFrame.

This project is a key step in understanding how to access and manipulate data in Pandas.
